# Notebooks for the optional works

* onnx.ipynb is an example of how to export simple models to onnx (just for me, for the future work)
* blip_fine_tune1.ipynb is about how to fine tune image captioning model using transformers Trainer
* blip_fine_tune2.ipynb is about how to fine tune image captioning model using pytorch_lightning. The process of thaining is here https://api.wandb.ai/links/kornilova_eka/m8qcpapm
* blip_fine_tune3.ipynb is about how to fine tune image captioning model using classiacal training loop. The output can found here https://huggingface.co/Eka-Korn/Image_Captioning_FineTuned
* mBART_fine_tune.ipynb is about how to fine tune summarization model using transformers Trainer. The output result can be found here https://huggingface.co/Eka-Korn/t5-russian-summarization
